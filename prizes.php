<h1>Prizes (revised in 2012)</h1>

Our crack staff of engineers and cooks (all 3 of us) will award prizes to:<br>
<br>

<ul>
  <li>Tastiest: The item we liked the best &mdash; arbitrarily &mdash; Could win with the flavor, the color, the texture, the smell, the shamanistic chanting and dancing, the way it makes us feel threatened, yet nurtured... who knows?</li>
  <li>Encore: The item we enjoyed the most presented by someone who has won in previous years in any category</li>
  <li>Newbie: The item we enjoyed the most presented by someone who has not yet won any award in previous years</li>
</ul>

<br>

Greg, Mr. Mike, and Jim will be the judges. Awards will be presented some time between 5 PM and 8 PM, possibly with or without an extra dose of hullaballoo. The decision of the panel is final. Probably.
