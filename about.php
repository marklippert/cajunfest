<h2>New to Cajunfest?</h2>
Never been to a <span style="color: #B5001E;">CajunFest</span> before? CajunFest is a big picnic, volleyball, and networking opportunity. You should bring a dish, park furniture, and a happy shiny face. And you can bring the family. You can pretend like you've gone to every CajunFest that ever was by (a) bringing something tasty to pass around (small servings for 10 is plenty), (b) grab a drink, and (c) either start playing volleyball or start talking to the person next to you, and (d) grabbing a plate, filling it with some of the best Cajun food you've ever had, and chowing down.<br>
<br>

Your hosts, Greg Stratton, Mike Passaretti, and Jim Kohli will provide basic (and/or fancy!) Cajun food, plates &amp; cutlery, tissues for sniffling into when you're done with your spicy food, beverages (and water! I really will have water, too!), and volleyball equipment. If you like, you should bring a favorite dish, as well.<br>

<h2>Diner Beware!</h2>

People have been known to attempt "cajun-izing" many bizarre things with varying results. May we suggest that it is not necessary to make something distinctly Cajun, per se &mdash; the idea is mostly to get something that's tasty and wouldn't taste bad if it just happened to get spiced up with some preferred hot sauces.<br>

<h2>Packin' any HEAT?</h2>
We will have plenty of hot sauce (millions of varieties!) (well, maybe only 50 or so!) on hand, so please prepare your meal in a manner that would have broad appeal (i.e., not too spicy). That will be best because anyone can then use the <span style="color: #B5001E;"><em>hot sauce</em></span> to jazz it up to meet or beat their personal heat threshold.
