CajunFest will be at the same location as 2005 through 2012: Waukesha's Horeb Park (also known as Horeb Spring Park). The shelter at Horeb Park has power (no generators needed), so bring your crockpot if you like.<br>
<br>

<a href="http://www.ci.waukesha.wi.us/web/guest/wprfpool">The pool</a> will also be open for public swimming until 8:00pm. Prices are $4.50 for adults [18 and over], $3.50 for kids [17 and under].<br>
<br>

<br>

<h2>Rain or Shine!</h2>
There is an enclosed shelter in the park, and we OWN it (well, okay, we've only just reserved the shelter and the tables, but it's effectively the same thing!). There is a pretty good playground there, with some new equipment, and the pool was just rebuilt so your kids may enjoy this outing, as well.<br>
<br>

<br>

<h2>Parking</h2>
The park has a parking lot. If that gets full, you can park along the road near the park.<br>
<br>

<br>

<h2>RSVP</h2>
You can do so <a href="rsvp.php">here</a> (and also see what folks are bringing)...<br>
